    Your name is Moses. Your mother, Nancy was an Enslaved African, but your
    father was named Henry, a white slave owner. A few years after you were
    born Henry’s wife grew very suspicious that her husband was your father.
    After some investigative work, it was revealed to be true. In a short
    amount of time you and your mother were sold to a cruel slave owner name
    Mr. Gooch. He seemed to revel in punishing those he owned. Your days
    were filled with hard toil in the fields and the fear of physical
    punishment. You began to contemplate whether it was time to runaway.
    If you are caught the punishment will be severe, but there is a chance of freedom.
